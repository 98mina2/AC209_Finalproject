Featured above and throughout the campaign are Jaiden Thomas and Jameese Joseph. Jameese (left) is a senior on NC State’s soccer team. She brought her athleticism and ability to score game-winning goals from her hometown of Beltsville, MD. She’s got great attack instincts, and her dribbling is a joy to watch. She’s a senior studying business administration when she’s off the field. Jameese loves to sleep - when she’s not practicing, at a game, at school, hanging with her friends, eating chicken Alfredo (her favorite food) or shopping with her dad; she loves fashion.

Jaiden (right) is a senior on NC State’s soccer team hailing from Ponte Vedra Beach, FL. She wasn’t always in the starting lineup, but her passion, drive, and commitment to the idea that more is possible has made her a standout player to watch. Outside of her team responsibilities she leads Pack United, a student-athlete activism group that recently worked to bring therapy dogs into the classroom for exams. She also loves to cook, and (although this is unverified by adidas) is very good at it. After college she plans to be an athletic director or work in administration. Jaiden’s favorite adidas collaboration is Ivy Park.
